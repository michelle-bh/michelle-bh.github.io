<div class="group" markdown="1">

**Diving into the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries to see if winning lottery numbers can be predicted or if the numbers are truly random using R code.**

*	Problem Statement - What answers are we searching for with the lottery data.

*	Data Exploration - What kind of information is available to work with.

*	Final Results - Exploring which numbers are drawn the most, in which states have the most winners, and information about the size of the Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots.
