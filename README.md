# Welcome!

<div class="group" markdown="1">


**These are some of my favorite projects and writings I created during the 2 1/2 years I spent earning my Master of Science in Data Science degree from Bellevue University in Bellevue, Nebraska.  The topics range from predicting bank failures to finding a new place to live to exploring the sales of electric vehicles.  Other topics include attendance at Dodger Stadium, a series of presentations on airline safety, and finally, my favorite writing, "Can Chicken Soup Cure the Common Cold?"**

**Enjoy!**

**Michelle Helfman's Data Science Portfolio consisting of 10 project sections ranging from Building Airline Confidence to Exploration of Electric Vehicle Sales to Predicting Bank Failures and more.**

*	[Building Airline Confidence](Building-Airline-Confidence/README.md):  A series of Tableau and PowerPoint visualizations and presentations focused on building confidence in air travel and Southwest Airlines.

*	[Dodger Stadium Attendance](Dodger-Stadium-Attendance/README.md):  Explore attendance at Los Angeles Dodger games by day of week, promotions, and opponents using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

*	[Electric Vehicles Sales Exploration](Electric-Vehicles-Sales-Exploration/README.md):  Using Big Data, the sales of electric vehicles in Seattle, Washington, are explored to facilitate advertising targeting by zip code to create additional profits.  Python (Jupyter Notebook), Apache NiFi, Hadoop HDFS, and Apache Hive

*	[Evaluating Credit Risk](Evaluating-Credit-Risk/README.md):  Demographics, current and historical loan information, and credit risk are evaluated for a new loan application using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
