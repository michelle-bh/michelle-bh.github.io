Welcome!

These are some of my favorite projects and writings I created during the 2 years I spent earning my Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University in Bellevue, Nebraska.  The topics range from predicting bank failures to finding a new place to live to exploring the sales of electric vehicles.  Other topics include attendance at Dodger Stadium, a series of presentations on airline safety, and finally, my favorite writing, "Can Chicken Cure the Common Cold?"

Enjoy!
