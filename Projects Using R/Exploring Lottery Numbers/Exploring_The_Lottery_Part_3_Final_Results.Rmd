# Introduction  

Lotteries are everywhere.  You can buy tickets at grocery stores, gas stations, 
airports, kiosks at the mall, everywhere...  Lottery sales exceeded $210 billion 
in 2021, and individuals, families, friends, and groups of co-workers want their 
piece of the lottery pie.

# What Is The Problem?

There are so many lotteries, single-state, multi-state, entire countries, and even 
spanning continents.  A lottery involves the drawing of numbers at random for a 
prize.  Which lottery should someone play?  How does someone know which numbers to 
choose?  Are some states better than others for purchasing tickets?  Are the numbers 
really random?

# How Do We Find The Answer?

The two most popular lotteries in the United States are Powerball and Mega Millions.  
Starting in January 2012 through October 15, 2022, the most common numbers, 
largest jackpots, the time between winners, and the states that sold the winning 
tickets are identified for each lottery.  Then, by comparing the Powerball and 
Mega Millions results to each other, focusing on the commonalities and differences 
to answer questions about which lottery to participate in, which numbers to include, 
and which states to reside in when purchasing tickets.

Statistical analysis of the available lottery data gives insight into the patterns 
and frequency of the numbers drawn and the size and frequency of jackpots.  The 
results will then be displayed graphically for ease of understanding.

The Mega Millions lottery is drawn twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays. Since 
January 2012, there have been `r toString(mm_num_drawings)` drawings.  The most 
drawn number is `r toString(mm_num_max)` and the least is `r toString(mm_num_min)`.
The table above shows the 20 most chosen lottery numbers.

mm_days_max <- max(as.numeric(mm_jackpots_day_df$mm_BETWEEN))
mm_days_min <- 3

# This is the average:  `r toString(days_avg)`
```

The Mega Millions lottery drawings are Tuedays and Fridays so the minimum time 
between winners is `r toString(mm_days_min)` days.  The longest period between 
wins is `r toString(mm_days_max)` days with the average being 
`r toString(mm_days_avg)`.  The biggest cluster is between 10 and 14 days.  Currently 
the Mega Millions jackpots start at $20 million, the biggest jackpot of $1.5 billion 
was at 91 days on 10/23/2018.  On 1/21/2021, at `r toString(mm_days_max)`, the 
winning jackpot was $1 billion.

pb_days_max <- max(as.numeric(pb_jackpots_day_df$pb_BETWEEN))
pb_days_min <- 3

```


The Powerball lottery drawings are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays so the minimum time 
between winners is `r toString(pb_days_min)` days.  The longest period between 
wins is `r toString(pb_days_max)` days with the average being 
`r toString(pb_days_avg)`.  The biggest cluster is between 7 and 10 days.  Currently 
the Powerball jackpots start at $20 million, the biggest jackpot of $1.5 billion 
was at 70 days on 1/13/2016.  On 1/22/2021, at `r toString(pb_days_max)`, the 
winning jackpot was $731 million.

```


While the most common numbers of the Mega Millions and Powerball lotteries are scattered throughout the 60 available numbers, the 3, 10 and 14 are popular to both lotteries.  There are no other commonalities between the 2 lotteries, adding support to the theory that lotteries are random.

## Annual Jackpots, Yearly Comparison

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10000, 40000, 5000))
```

Lottery payouts are directly tied to ticket sales.  More sales means larger jackpots and larger annual payouts.  In 2010, the Mega Millions and Powerball lotteries had a cross-sales expansion.  This is where states and locations already selling Powerball would now sell Mega Millions tickets and those selling Mega Millions would now sell Powerball tickets.  In recent years, both lotteries are in sync with their annual payouts, but in 2012 and 2013, while Powerball annual winnings increased, Mega Millions decreased.  This could be due to post expansion adoption issues.  Mega Millions expanded into 31 states, while Powerball added an additional 14 states for sales.  

* The Powerball jackpot winnings do not include the $2 billion Powerball jackpot 
on 11/7/2022.
* Winning jackpot amounts are divided by 100K.

\newpage
## States With The Most Winners
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./States_Comparison.png')
```


Whether the states have large populations or small, any state can have lottery winners.  Starting in 2012, Powerball has more people winning jackpots overall.  The states with the largest populations should have more ticket sales leading to more winners, but this graph shows states with smaller populations have a more significant number of jackpot winners.  Indiana, Minnesota, and Missouri have the most winners.  These states were already selling Powerball tickets when they started participating in the Mega Millions as part of the cross-sales expansion of 2010.  This might be due to the lack of familiarity with the Mega Millions lottery and being comfortable in purchasing Powerball tickets.


\newpage
# The Results - Expected or Surprising

## What Met Expectations?  
  1.  The outrageously large lottery prizes (over $1 billion) for both lotteries 
  are extremely rare and take a long time to build up.  Most of the winning 
  numbers (50%), are drawn at less than 40 days.
  2.  The 2 lotteries are separate with very few commonalities with regard to 
  numbers drawn and states where winners reside.
  3.  The effect Covid-19 in 2020 had on lottery ticket sales and jackpot sizes 
  due to the uncertainty of continues employment, quarantines, and the lottery 
  sales locations being closed.
  
## What Was Surprising?  
  1.  The longest periods between winning drawings did not produce the largest 
  jackpots.  The largest Powerball jackpot ($1.5 billion) was at 70 days, while 
  the jackpot produced at 126 days had winnings of $731 million. For Mega Millions, 
  the largest jackpot ($1.5 billion) was at 91 days, while the jackpot produced 
  as 129 days was only $1 billion.
  2.  The longest time between winners for both Mega Millions and Powerball 
  happened at the same time frame between mid-September 2020 through the week of 
  1/20/2021.
  3.  The states with the biggest population did not produce the most jackpot 
  winners.  Ticket sales do not dictate whee the winners come from.
  4.  There was a significant drop in Mega Millions payouts for 2017 without any 
  discern-able reason beyond Powerball having it's best year in 2016.  
  
# What Are The Limitations And Can It Be Expanded To Produce Useable Results?
The scope of this lottery study was looking at the largest jackpots and the time 
between winners.  Looking at winning smaller amounts using 3 numbers, might produce 
results that could predict a payout.  Also exploring numbers drawn in state lotteries, 
possibly a small sampling will produce predictable winning results.

# Final Thoughts.
Lotteries like Mega Millions and Powerball are just a set of balls of the same 
weight and size that roll around in an air filled container until one is captured 
and the number is revealed.  Everything is equal, making these lotteries truly 
random and winners are really the luck of the draw.

***[Powerball - Winning Jackpot and State information 2003 to present](https://www.powerball.net/winners)*** - This webpage has both state and

jackpot related data has 6 columns.  Two columns have jackpot amounts, I will
be using the Annuity Value column since this is the publicized amount. 

***[Mega Millions - Winning Jackpot and State information from 2002 to present](https://mega-millions.com/winners)*** - This webpage has both state and 
jackpot information.  The dataset with state information has 3 columns.  The

the week, which will need to be removed before standardizing this 
particular column.
